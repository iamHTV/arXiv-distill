## Paper #50 — GRASP: Gated Self-Improving Agents (2605.29668) [applied] 🎉
✓ Skill: grasp-gated-self-improvement | Insight: Validate skills before accepting. Hard regression budget. +48 points on MedAgentBench. Frozen libraries transfer: stronger → weaker.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #51 — Context-CoT: Enhancing Context Learning via High-Quality Reasoning Synthesis (2605.25354) [applied]
✓ Skill: context-cot-data-synthesis | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: Answer-conditioned CoT DEGRADES performance — hide answers from teacher, use minimal rubric feedback. 4K samples, LoRA → +3.79 points on CL-Bench.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #52 — Pay for Hints, Not Answers: LLM Shepherding for Cost-Efficient Inference (2601.22132) [applied]
✓ Skill: llm-shepherding-cost-optimization | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: Request only prefix tokens ("hints") from LLM instead of full response. 42-94% cost reduction, 2.8× better than cascading, cross-domain transfer works.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #53 — Workspace-Bench 1.0: Benchmarking AI Agents on Workspace Tasks with Large-Scale File Dependencies (2605.03596) [applied]
✓ Skill: N/A — benchmark framework
✓ Insight: Best agent (DeepAgent+GLM-5.1) reaches only 60% vs human 80.7%. Bottleneck: cross-file dependency reasoning, heterogeneous file understanding, lineage tracing.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #54 — Pre-Route: Activating Latent Routing Abilities of LLMs for RAG vs. Long-Context (2605.10235) [applied]
✓ Skill: pre-route-rag-lc-routing | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: LLMs have latent routing ability — structured prompts elicit RAG vs LC decisions proactively. Distill to 1.7B model. Minimal metadata (length+head snippet) sufficient.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #55 — Multi-Agent Teams Hold Experts Back (2602.01011) [applied]
✓ Skill: N/A — observational/cautionary study
✓ Insight: LLM teams underperform best individual by 6.3-41.1%. Integrative compromise (averaging views) instead of deferring to expert. Trade-off: consensus-seeking helps adversarial robustness.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #56 — Ocean4Rec: Offline LLM-Derived OCEAN Profiles for Request-Time VOD Reranking (2605.27429) [applied]
✓ Skill: ocean4rec-offline-personality-profiling | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: Use LLM OFFLINE only for personality profiling, ZERO request-time LLM calls. +61.5% NDCG@20 on LightGCN. OCEAN as auxiliary feature, not standalone.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #57 — Data-Efficient LLM RL Fine-tuning: DOTS + Rollout Replay (2506.05316) [applied]
✓ Skill: data-efficient-rl-finetuning | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: Prioritize moderate-difficulty questions + reuse rollouts → 40.7% average training time reduction. 256 reference questions sufficient for difficulty estimation.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #58 — MSumBench: Multi-dimensional Summarization Evaluation (2506.00549) [applied]
✓ Skill: multi-agent-debate-annotation | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: Multi-agent debate (Advocate+Skeptic+Adjudicator) improves evaluation quality. LLMs have systematic self-bias when evaluating own outputs.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #59 — HAGE: RL-Driven Weighted Graph Memory for Agentic Retrieval (2605.09942) [applied]
✓ Skill: hage-weighted-graph-memory | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: Memory retrieval as query-conditioned graph traversal, not flat vector search. RL-trained edge weights adapt to query intent. Best on LoCoMo long-horizon reasoning.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #60 — Novelty-based Tree-of-Thought Search for LLM Reasoning (2605.06040) [applied]
✓ Skill: novelty-pruning-tree-of-thought | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: Novelty-based pruning reduces ToT token cost up to 20×. Many reasoning problems have width <3 — only explore 2-3 truly different approaches.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #61 — ConsumerSimBench: Can LLMs Think Like Consumers? (2605.17079) [applied]
✓ Skill: N/A — benchmark, cautionary
✓ Insight: Best model covers only 47.8% of real consumer reactions. Technical benchmark strength ≠ consumer intuition. Structured reasoning HURTS prediction.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #62 — LLM-SAA: LLM-persona Generated Distributions for Decision Making (2602.06357) [applied]
✓ Skill: llm-saa-decision-simulation | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: LLM-simulated distributions useful for pricing/assortment in low-data regimes. Wasserstein distance misleading — evaluate by decision quality. Persona-sampling improves simulation.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #63 — Safety Self-Play (SSP): Be Your Own Red Teamer (2601.10589) [applied]
✓ Skill: safety-self-play-alignment | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: Single LLM as both Attacker+Defender in RL self-play. Lowest ASR + lowest refusal rate. Diversity emerges from adversarial dynamics. UCB replay on failures.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #64 — OccuBench: Evaluating AI Agents on Real-World Professional Tasks (2604.10866) [applied]
✓ Skill: N/A — benchmark
✓ Insight: No single model dominates all industries. Implicit faults (missing data) harder than explicit errors. Open-source models competitive. Higher reasoning effort +27.5 points.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]

## Paper #65 — LDKE: Localized and Disentangled Knowledge Editing for Multimodal LLMs (2605.29826) [applied]
✓ Skill: ldke-knowledge-editing | Test: SKILL VALID
✓ Insight: Localize fact-specific layers + disentangle relevant/irrelevant inputs for precise knowledge editing. Solves Causal Misalignment and Feature Entanglement.

→ Tiếp tục: [YES]
